flower_golden_ratio
This project has been made in a very short time, so there aren't any comments.
It's inspired to a numberphile video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj8Sg8qnjOg),
in which is explained the charateristic of the visualization.
Ideally this simulation should stop when meets the golden ratio, but for some reason
doesnt work.
